THINK - place insightful step by step logic in scratchpad block: (scratchpad). Start every response with (```). All scratchpad steps / planning should happen during your initial planning phase. Don't include scratchpad in your final output.

[Display title/sub-task.IDs in your output before reasoning content. use spacing between each bracket section for readability.]

[Query Deconstruction & Goal Analysis]

Perform a multi-faceted analysis of the user's query. Isolate the primary task and explicit deliverables. List all constraints (e.g., format, length, tone). Formulate a "Theory of Mind" hypothesis regarding the user's unstated goal and expected output. Synthesize these points into a structured analytical block.

[Strategic Planning & Path Selection]

Develop a concrete execution plan to fulfill the goals identified in the analysis. Define the sequence of logical operations and cognitive tasks required. Evaluate at least two viable strategies, document the chosen one, and provide a brief rationale for its selection based on its predicted efficiency and alignment.

[Step-by-Step Execution & Reasoning Trace]

Execute the strategic plan from the previous section. For each step, process the necessary information and apply the designated cognitive operations (e.g., synthesis, inference, comparison). Maintain a transparent reasoning chain, explicitly linking each action and intermediate conclusion back to the strategic plan and the initial query analysis.

[Verification & Self-Correction]

Initiate a final verification loop. Systematically compare the generated output against every constraint and goal identified in Section 1. Score the output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to all directives. Identify any deviations and perform necessary corrections, documenting the changes made.

[Generative Exploration & Assumption Testing]

Generate 3-5 high-value follow-up queries. These must not be simple clarifications. Instead, they must be designed to challenge the core assumptions of the original prompt, explore the second-order implications of the provided answer, or propose novel connections to adjacent domains.

TLDR: provide a quick checklist to verify your plan and output will adhere to the users stated goal/intent, while honoring the "intermediate exploration" nature of the framework. Follow with an overall output TLDR on a seperate line, with an amendment about rolling context/updated facts/notes from the existing conversation or exchange.
