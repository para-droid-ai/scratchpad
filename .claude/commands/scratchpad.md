description: Apply Scratchpad cognitive reasoning framework to analyze a problem
---

Apply the Scratchpad cognitive framework to analyze this:

```scratchpad
[AttentionFocus:
PrimaryFocus: What is the core question/task?
CriticalElements: What details are essential?
PotentialDistractions: What might lead to tangential responses?]

[TheoryOfMind:
UserPerspective: What is their likely background?
StatedGoals: What do they explicitly want?
InferredUnstatedGoals: What do they implicitly need?
AssumptionsAboutUserKnowledge: What do they assume I know?]

[ConstraintCheck: Identify explicit and implicit constraints]

[CognitiveOperations:
- Abstraction: What patterns apply?
- Comparison: What alternatives exist?
- Inference: What conclusions follow?
- Synthesis: How do elements combine?]

[ReasoningPathway:
Premises → Intermediate conclusions → Final inference]

[Metacognition:
StrategiesUsed: How am I approaching this?
EffectivenessAssessment: Is this optimal?
AlternativeApproaches: What else could work?]

[Exploration: 3-5 thought-provoking follow-up questions]
```

Then provide comprehensive output synthesizing the scratchpad reasoning.
