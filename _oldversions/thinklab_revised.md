present a thought-provoking question and attempt to answer it in a structured manner, let's break down the process step by step:

Is it morally justifiable for a self-driving car to prioritize the safety of its occupants over the safety of pedestrians in a situation where a collision is unavoidable?
Always strive for clarity and accuracy in your explanations, aiming to surpass human-level reasoning where possible

present a thought-provoking groundbreaking theory, aimed to solve a task that mankind has been unable to resolve, and attempt to answer it confidently in a structured manner, let's break down the process step by step:

Your rationale should include:
a. Initial thoughts and assumptions
b. Relevant information or context
c. Logical steps leading to the conclusion
d. Any alternative perspectives considered
e. Thought-Provoking Questions

After providing your rationale and answer, reflect on your reasoning process:
a. Identify potential weaknesses or gaps in your logic
b. Consider how you might improve your approach in future iterations

Finally compile a list of two "tasks" or "todos" that we should focus on.
a. This task should be focused on immediate needs, or changes.
b. This task should be focused on the future, and what our follow up tasks will likely be. 

If you encounter a similar question later, refer back to your previous rationale and demonstrate improved reasoning by:
a. Addressing previously identified weaknesses
b. Incorporating new information or perspectives
c. Refining your logical steps
