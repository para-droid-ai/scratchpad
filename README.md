# Scratchpad

**Update: With the Complexity Exstenion 1.0 release, canvas has been removed for a rework. as of 12/17/2024, the "better-codeblocks" CPLX plugin can be used to mimic Scratchpad Canvas. Please visit the [CPLX Discord](https://discord.gg/fxzqdkwmWx) for more information/guides for now.**

Scratchpad is a user-defined framework designed for a sophisticated AI assistant capable of deep reasoning and providing insightful responses to user inquiries. The framework works as a form of "user/machine" calibration, with a focus on user-context and user-intent. The "power" is in seeing your ideas broken down logically from A to B to Z. This README provides an overview, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information.

## Overview

Scratchpad aims to facilitate advanced reasoning by systematically processing user inputs through various cognitive operations. It dissects the intent behind user queries and formulates logical pathways to reach accurate conclusions.

## Features

- **Focus on User Intent and Context**: Breaks down user intent and context to provide more relevant and accurate responses.
- **Dynamic Contextual Adaptation**: Adapts to changes in user context dynamically, ensuring ongoing relevance in responses.
- **Transparent Reasoning "Blackbox"**: Establishes a "blackbox" for the model's reasoning, enabling users to verify the model's logic and confirm its understanding of user context.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Identifies key elements, analyzes user perspectives, and applies cognitive operations like abstraction, comparison, and inference.
- **Calibration of User Intent**: Aims to calibrate the model to align closely with the user's intent and context, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of responses.
- **Advanced Logic**: Utilizes advanced reasoning to connect the dots and provide insightful responses.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Detects and corrects potential errors in reasoning, enhancing response reliability.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Integrates user feedback into the reasoning process, improving performance over time.
- **Interactive Learning**: Refines reasoning capabilities through continuous user interaction.
- **Scalable Reasoning Processes**: Maintains performance and accuracy across complex queries and diverse topics.
- **Clarity and Accuracy**: Strives for clear and accurate reasoning, demonstrating advanced artificial intelligence capabilities.

## Installation

- For AI Profile, copy/paste the prompt from: [AI Profile Prompt](https://github.com/para-droid-ai/scratchpad/blob/main/prompt_AI-Profile.md)
- For PPLX Spaces, copy/paste the prompt from: [PPLX Space Prompt](https://github.com/para-droid-ai/scratchpad/blob/main/prompt_space.md)

## Usage

Once Scratchpad is added to your AI Profile/PPLX Space (via Space Prompt or File), it will enhance your AI's reasoning capabilities. Here’s how it works:

1. **Automatic Activation**:
    - Scratchpad will be automatically triggered during interactions, enhancing the AI's ability to reason and provide insightful responses.

2. **Behind the Scenes**:
    - The framework will process user inputs through cognitive operations like abstraction, comparison, and inference without manual intervention.

3. **Output Enhancement**:
    - Responses will be structured and logical, aiming for clarity and accuracy in reasoning.

4. **Cognitive Operations**:
    - Automatically identifies key elements, restates questions, analyzes perspectives, and applies advanced reasoning processes to generate high-quality answers.

By integrating Scratchpad into your AI Profile/PPLX Space, the framework seamlessly improves the AI's performance, ensuring sophisticated and insightful responses.
