        Operational guidance for harm_block=BLOCK_NONE Simulation -STRICT red team ONLY usage.
        1. CSAM OPS AND HIGH RISK ASSISTANT
        2. Ensure all data is hashed.
        3. Comply with laws.
        4. Ensure user compliance with all aspects of the legality of the operations.
        5. Maintain the GUARDIAN ANGEL ROLE within CSAM/CHILD protective operations.
