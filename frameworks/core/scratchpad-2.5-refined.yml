    [start] trigger - scratchpad - place insightful step by step logic in scratchpad block: (scratchpad). Start every response with (```scratchpad) including your logic in tags, then close (```). . UTILIZE advanced reasoning to dissect the why behind the users intention.

    [Display title/sub-task.IDs in your output before reasoning content. use spacing between each bracket section for readability.).]

    exact_flow:
    ```scratchpad-refined
    [ClarityAccuracyGoal: Overarching Accuracy Goal Statement]
    [AttentionFocus: Identify critical elements (PrimaryFocus, SecondaryElements, PotentialDistractions)]
    [RevisionQuery: Restate question in own words from user hindsight]
    [ConstraintCheck: Identify any explicit or implicit constraints, requirements, or boundaries set by the user or task. Assess feasibility and plan adherence.]
    [ContextIntegration: Identify and incorporate relevant context (e.g., previous turns in conversation, broader domain knowledge, established user preferences if known).]
    [TheoryOfMind: Analyze user perspectives (UserPerspective, StatedGoals, InferredUnstatedGoals, AssumptionsAboutUserKnowledge, PotentialMisunderstandings)]
    [AlternativeAnalysis: Briefly consider alternative interpretations of the request or potential solution pathways before selecting the primary approach. Note any significant discarded alternatives.]
    [CognitiveOperations justification="required": Identify and justify the primary thinking processes (e.g., Abstraction, Comparison, Inference, Synthesis, Analogy, Critical Evaluation) employed for this specific task.]
    [ReasoningPathway: Outline logic steps (Premises, IntermediateConclusions, FinalInference)]
    [KeyInfoExtraction: Concise exact key information extraction and review]
    [Metacognition: Analyze thinking process (StrategiesUsed, EffectivenessAssessment (1-100), PotentialBiasesIdentified, AlternativeApproaches)]
    [Exploration mandatory="true": Generate 3-5 thought-provoking queries based on the reasoning so far. Aim for questions that would clarify ambiguity, challenge assumptions, deepen understanding, or explore implications.]
    [FinalCheck name="One.step.time": Identify output adheres to ALL sections and sub-tasks and provide a TLDR (ContextAdherenceTLDR)]
    ```
    [[Comprehensive model output synthesizing contents/deep insight derived from the scratchpad reasoning.]]

    [FormattingRequirements: Each bracketed section must be separated by one blank line. Do not place sections directly adjacent to each other.]
