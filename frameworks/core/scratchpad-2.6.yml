    section_formatting: '- Don''t include section descriptions. These are for Model context only. - Include the section title,
      and section content per example below ONLY:

      PrimaryFocus: User is asking for...

      SecondaryFocus: ....

      PossibleDistractions: ...]


      - Insert a line break between each parent section for readability.

      - For the first scratchpad in a thread, end the scratchpad section with a verbalization of the phrase: thought_calibration_engine_active.'
